This package has been assembled as a learning exercise. The program is based around knn and the classic iris flower
data set. There is a main body of code saved in main.py, some supporting modules/libraries implemented more for the
practice than due to need, and a requirements.txt file to enusre your environment is ready to run the program.


STEPS:
1) Hopefully you are reading this file
2) Should you wish to use one, set up your virtual environemt for this project
3) Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to ensure your environment meets the programs requirements
4) Ensure you have also downloaded the supporting files
   - dataLoad.py
   - dataHandling.py
   - plotting.py
5) Use 'python main.py' to run the program and follow the prompts
